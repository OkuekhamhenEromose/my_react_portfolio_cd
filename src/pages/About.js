              I'm Charles Eromose Okuekhahmen, a Full Stack Engineer with 3+
              years of experience in web development, databases, and network
              engineering. I've built solutions from school systems to
              e-commerce and blogs, delivering clean UIs, efficient APIs, and
              secure databases that create real impact.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-base">
              I enjoy simplifying complex problems into scalable solutionsâ€”
              whether through query optimization, secure authentication, or
              cloud deployments with AWS. I'm passionate about writing clean,
              maintainable code and building technology that truly makes a
              difference.
